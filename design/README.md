# Design
## Initial concept
So this is an extremely original idea.

The premise is pretty much the same as the original: you have a ship that's floating in the nothingness of cosmos
where deadly asteroids can sweep you away in a second. The most important feature of the original is that the ships
have inertia.  

Yup, Asteroids 2.0. Although as you can see the name is now Multiroids.
Why Multiroids? Well, glad you asked. The revolutinary idea is to make MULTIple ships that the user controls.

So the idea is that the player has multiple ships that he can control. By default any inputs the player does should
influence all ships, however we might want to have control groups that work somewhat like control groups in games like
Warcraft III: you can click-and-drag an area and whatever is in that selected region will get selected, this is called
a `control group`. Now, if you have many units, you might want to create groups between which you could switch quickly.
If you press `Ctrl + [0-9]` while you have a control group selected it will save it which can then be quickly accessed
by again pressing `Ctrl + [number you used to save the command group]`. When a control group is selected, the player's
input should only effect the ships in the current `control group`.

One more incentive to name the game Multiroids is the fact that it should be MULTIplayer.

This is a rough outline about how the battlefield could look like: multiple control groups of one player and multiple
control groups of the other player duking it out while at the same time trying to not get destroyed by the asteroids.

Now, the game `Universe` in idea should be limitless (although players should spawn in some general area).
Because of that players should have the zooming functionality.

The scale of the `Universe` encourages the functionality of a map.

So far this has no "hook" so to say. While it is quite difficult to think up of unique ideas we can have stuff which
makes a lot of sense in a `Universe` of this game. 
E.g.

We could add black holes / worm holes for a gravity mechanic which would be pretty interesting and possibly difficult
to deal with when coupled with the inertia that the ships have.

Furthermore, we could have multiple types of ships although I feel like we should limit ourselves to a very limited
number of ships.
E.g. of a ship type: ship pair that have an electric arc in between:

E.g of a ship type: big ship that could be used for ramming / coverage.
